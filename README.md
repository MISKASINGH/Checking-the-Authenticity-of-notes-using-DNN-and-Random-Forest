# Checking-the-Authenticity-of-notes-using-DNN-and-Random-Forest
Using DNN to predict authentication of Notes
We'll use the Bank Authentication Data Set from the UCI repository.

The data consists of 5 columns (features):

variance of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
skewness of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
curtosis of Wavelet Transformed image (continuous)
entropy of image (continuous)
class (integer)
Where class indicates whether or not a Bank Note is authentic.
